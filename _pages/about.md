# About me
I am a third-year PhD student in the Computer Science department at UC Santa Barbara. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Ben Hardekopf](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~benh/) and [Jonathan Balkind](https://jbalkind.github.io/). I obtained my Bachelor degrees in Computer Science from Peking University and was lucky to work with Professor [Yingfei Xiong](https://xiongyingfei.github.io/) as a member of [PKU-PLL](https://pl.cs.pku.edu.cn/en/).

My interests primarily lie in the areas of software engineering and programming languages. 
At present, I am focused on utilizing these techniques to solve problems related to hardware.
